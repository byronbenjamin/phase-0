      Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the
      learn how to dissect an HTML page from the to the , add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the HTML docs (Links to an external site.)) and begin!

    <header>Release 0: Set up</header>

    Decide who will drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:

    Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory
    Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory
    Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.
    Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes.
    SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html (Links to an external site.)

    <footer>
    NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles halfway through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple Google doc).

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

HTML5 tags that I have used includes header, footer, aside and section. I use them because I didnt its easier to ready when youre coding. Header and footer are almost included on every site so when using the header and footer tags you know whats usually included in them. You also know how to find them easily within the code.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements get laid out on a page in the order in which you want them to appear. You usually start with the html tags, then the head tags, and then th body tags.

The browser then displays these elements in the same order not unless you use css to position them differently.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learn some shortcuts in sublime this challenge. I learned about the html snippet and i also learned how to create my own. I think I create more snippets later. I think they are a good tool. With alot of projects i see that you start with the basics. So if you create a snippet to get those basics on the page you can have a headstart at completing your project.

I think I will research some shortcuts to see whats available to help me with future projects. -->

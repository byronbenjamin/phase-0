**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**

You can use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements by trying different settings until you find what youre looking for. Here you can make changes and see results without saving them. Youre able to experiment and if you dont like the changes you have made you can just refresh the page, resetting the page, and try again.

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**

You can resize elements on the DOM using CSS by changing the width and the height. You can also change the setting of the margins and padding.

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**

Absolute position is based on its nearest relatively positioned parent element.

Fixed position element will always be positioned based on the browser window.

Static positioning elements will stack in a standard one-after-another order.

Relative positioning is positioned wherever you set it.

Relative is the most difficult. You first have to set the element to relative positioning. Then you have to figure out what settings to enter to place the element on the page where you want it.

**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**

Margin is the space outside the border.
Padding is the space between the content and the border.
Border is the space betweent the margin and padding.

**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**

I thought this challenge was fun, I loved it. It allowed me to do alot of different things with the dom. I was able to make changes and see them appear right away. I like figuring things out as well so when I got stuck I kept trying until me or my pair figured it out.

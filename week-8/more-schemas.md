#What is a one-to-one database?#

One-to-one database is a database where 2 tables or entities can be linked by ONE element. So table 1 can link to table 2 by one row and table 2 can link to table 1 by that same row.

#When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).#

one-to-one database would be used if you have a table that has a column where a row can possibly be null. You can create another table (table 2) to eliminate that problem. so table 1 would refer to table 2 for that row and table 2 would only provide information of that element for table 1.

#What is a many-to-many database?#

two tables that can link by multiple rows. A join table is created to join the two tables.

#When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).#

many-to-many would be used if you have two tables where table 1 can link to multiple rows in table 2 and a row in table 2 can link to muliple rows in table 1.


#What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?#

Knowing when to use a certain database schemas and understanding the use and the data that goes into each table is confusing.

What makes sense is reading them. I can understand whats going on when they're already completed.

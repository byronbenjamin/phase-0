#Think About Time Reflection

1. I learned about meditation, time boxing, learning how to schedule tasks, learned how to multi task, balancing work and personal life.

2. Time boxing is scheduling task into separate time periods. This can be used in Phase 0 by scheduling the assignments into different days of the week. Do so many one day and maybe work more on the weekends.

3. I manage my time currently by importance of the task. The more important or time sensitive things get done asap and those that are not will get done eventually. Not unless there importance change.

4. Yes.

5. Yes. I know with coding and the assignment we will be giving we have to make time to complete them by the due date. So i will be able to manage what i have to do in order to get the work done.

6. I will look at what needs to be done when the assignments are giving. I'll set a goal for each one. Ill dedicate a certain amount of time during the week to work on assignments and work even longer on the weekends.

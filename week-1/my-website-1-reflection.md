    Describe what open source means.

    open source means to give all access of your code to other developers so that they can help build and share their code.

    What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

    I think it helpful if you need the help with your projects and dont have time or enough man power to build. Also if youre new and you need help and guidance its helpful as well. It would only make me nervous or protective if it were a big project. Something i plan on making money with or a business. I dont think it would be utopia. You might not get the best help or results all the time.

    Assess the importance of using licenses.

    Licenses grant specific permissions for others to use that work. So a person can't have full access to your work. Because they have to ask for permission before doing certain things it allows the owner to manage and control their work the way they want to.

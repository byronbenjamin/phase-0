**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

My site's primary purpose is to provide information about myself and show my work.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

My target audience will come to my site looking for assistance with developing a website. My site will address them by sharing my work history, my background, and my past projects.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

The primary action I want the user to take is to come to the site and navigate through focusing primarily on my work history and past projects. I think that is most important because they're able to see your work in person.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

They should know that the most important thing is catering to your target audience. You want to design your site according to who your target audience is. For example if you're building a site for kids you would want to use bright colors and cartoon characters. You also want to make it easy for your audience to navigate your site easily.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User Experience Design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product.

This is valuable because the overall purpose of a website, web application, or software is to be used by a user. So you want to make their experience easy by making it easy for them to navigate and use the site or application.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

I did not find this challenge to be tedious.

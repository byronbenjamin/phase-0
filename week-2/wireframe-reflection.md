**What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. It's a blueprint or draft that contains the elements of the website you are working on.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

It allows you to define the information hierarchy of your design, making it easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to process the information. It's also like brainstorming. It allows you to see all of your ideas on paper before you start creating.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

I did, I enjoyed putting together my ideas and designing my first couple web pages.

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I stuck to my first idea. As I go forward I'm sure I'll make changes.

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

I did not have any questions but I did use the readings as a resource for putting together my wireframe.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I enjoyed designing the wireframe. I used Mockingbird which allowed me to add and drop different features into the wireframe. I enjoyed playing around with different ideas.

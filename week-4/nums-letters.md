**What does puts do?**

Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

A Integer is a number without decimal a point. A float is a number with a decimal point.

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

Integer division returns a integer number no matter what the true answer is.If the 2 integers you are dividing equal a float, the computer returns your number rounded down to the nearest integer.

Float division returns the true answer whether it be a integer or float.

```ruby
puts 24 * 365
8760
```

```ruby
puts (24 * 60) * (365 * 10)
5256000
```

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

ruby handles addition, subtraction, and multiplication the same as a calculator would.

ruby handles addtion by adding numbers
ruby handles subtraction by subtracting numbers
ruby handle multiplication by multiplying numbers

With division it is a little different.

If you divide floats your result will be a float, which is a number with a decimal.
If you divide integers your result will be a integer even if the true answer is a float. ruby round the number down to the nearest integer and returns that number.

**What is the difference between integers and floats?**

A integer does not have a decimal. A float has a decimal.

**What is the difference between integer and float division?**

Integer division returns a integer number no matter what the true answer is.If the 2 integers you are dividing equal a float, the computer returns your number rounded down to the nearest integer.

Float division returns the true answer whether it be a integer or float.

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

Strings are groups of letters in a program. I would use them to enter names, words or phrases into my program.

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

local variables are variables that are declared within a method. They are used in methods. I would use them in methods to keep them seperate from global variables.

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**

This challenge was pretty simple. I remembered most of it as I read through the readings. Preparing for DBC I learned this with codeacademy but forgot about some since because its been a litle over a month since seeing it. I got a good review of the basics.
